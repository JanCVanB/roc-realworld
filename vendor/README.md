# Exploratory vendored dependencies

Like the rest of the repo, this is just an exploration of ideas for third-party packages
that a real version of this code base might hypothetically use.

None of them are intended to actually build or work as-is! Mostly they are an exploration
of APIs and seeing how things fit together - e.g. which things are in the platform, which
things are in pacakges, which modules should use params and which ones shouldn't, etc.
